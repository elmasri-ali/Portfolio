# Data Scientist
## About Me

As data scientists, we make sense of data to tell a story. Similarly, my story is nothing more than the small decisions and choices I have made and the people I have encountered. My first summer job in high school was as an assistant and sailor with yachts at a marina in Lebanon. During my summer job, I was able to meet different people with different backgrounds and engage in deep and stimulating conversations; this excitement of meeting and engaging with other people shaped my career path.

My name is Ali El Masri and I am an aspiring data scientist focusing on machine learning. I currently have a B.A. in Hospitality Management and extensive experience in the lodging industry. My journey into the hotels and hospitality industry was driven by my passion for traveling and connecting with people from different backgrounds and cultures. My journey in the hospitality industry has been very fulfilling, and I have had the pleasure of working with professionals and connecting with many coworkers who have all been of great influence on one another. I have had the pleasure of meeting numerous guests throughout the years, and although we have gone our separate ways, a long-lasting memory was always shared.

After a decade of working in the industry in different cities, I grew an interest in the revenue management field within the industry due to its intellectual stimulation, which thus led me to the field of data science. The intellectual challenges and brain-stimulating problems led me to pursue my Master of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University. During my two-year program, I was able to learn to apply techniques in ways I did not even know existed. I might have reached the end of my academic journey, but I know that my learning journey has just begun in this ever-evolving industry, and this is what excites me the most. I strive to gain experience and deepen my knowledge with every new project. By combining my experience in hospitality with my data science techniques and curiosity of the unknown, I aim to solve data-driven problems focusing on the hospitality and airline industry through machine and deep learning and look to innovate and find new ways to help organizations achieve their revenue and guest satisfaction goals through data.

# Academic Projects

## Dota2 Performance Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing player behavior and performance in DotA 2 using data collected through the OpenDota API. It includes two approaches, one through R and one through Python. It aims to uncover patterns and correlations between various gameplay elements and match outcomes. The study involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to identify key factors influencing wins and losses. A logistic regression model is employed to predict match outcomes based on in-game metrics such as kills, assists, hero damage, and economic factors. The findings offer insights into improving gameplay strategies and understanding the dynamics of player performance over time.

## Death Classification Model for Himalayan Expeditions

This project involves developing a classification model to predict the probability of death for climbers during Himalayan expeditions. Utilizing historical data from 1905 to 2020 sourced from Kaggle, the project analyzes various factors such as age, gender, experience, peak difficulty, and season of climb. The model aims to identify key determinants that increase the likelihood of fatal outcomes and uses this information to improve the safety planning of future expeditions. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the evaluation of multiple machine learning models, the project seeks to create a robust predictive tool for enhancing climber safety.

## Impact of Higher Education and Professional Certificates on Employment and Salary Outcomes

This project investigates the impact of higher education and professional certificates on employment and salary outcomes, particularly within the data science field. It uses datasets from Kaggle and the United States Census Bureau to analyze correlations between educational attainment and earnings. By employing both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, including random forest models and clustering techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the relative effectiveness of formal education versus certifications in enhancing employability and salary potential. The findings are intended to inform learners, educational institutions, and policymakers about the most beneficial educational investments for career advancement.

## Comparative Analysis of Hotel Reviews: A Case Study of New York Marriott Marquis and Competitors

This study offers a detailed comparative analysis of hotel reviews for the New York Marriott Marquis and its top five competitors in New York City. By detecting languages, applying topic modeling, conducting sentiment analysis, and visualizing various metrics, we aim to derive actionable insights. The primary goal is to provide recommendations that can ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge. Of importance, this dataset is not a definitive representation of the hotelâ€™s operations but instead an example for educational purposes derived from a limited set of reviews from 2012.

## Safeguarding the Blue Skies: Airline Safety through Data

This project involves five small data visualization tasks aimed at addressing negative public perception of airline safety due to recent media reports. The tasks include creating an internal dashboard, preparing an executive summary, writing a blog post, designing an infographic, and recording a video presentation. Each task builds on the previous one using data from various sources to analyze and visualize trends and statistics that support the safety of air travel. The dashboard and executive summary are intended for internal review, while the blog post, infographic, and video presentation target external audiences. The project emphasizes effective storytelling, ethical considerations, and appropriate visualization techniques to communicate the airline's message clearly and accurately.

## Predictive Modeling for Hotel Booking Cancellations
