# Data Scientist

![Ali El Masri](profile.png)

Hey there! üëã I'm Ali El Masri üòÉ, a data scientist üß™ with a zest for machine learning and a heart full of adventure!‚õ∑Ô∏èMy journey has been a thrilling ride, much like my love for exploring the Arctic with my wife, where the winter ambiance is simply magical, and skiing through pristine snow is an exhilarating experience.

My story began with small choices and serendipitous encounters. My first high school summer job as an assistant and sailor at a marina in Lebanon was a gateway to fascinating conversations and diverse friendships that sparked my passion for connecting with people.

With a B.A. in Hospitality Management and a rich background in the lodging industry, my career in hospitality was driven by my love for travel and meeting people from all walks of life. Each encounter left an indelible mark, creating lasting memories and shaping my professional path.

After a decade in hospitality across various cities, my curiosity led me to revenue management and eventually to the intellectually stimulating world of data science. I pursued a Master of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University, diving into the depths of machine learning and discovering new techniques that fueled my excitement.

As my academic journey concluded, I realized my learning had just begun. Every new project offers a chance to deepen my knowledge and solve data-driven challenges, particularly in the hospitality and airline industries. By blending my hospitality experience with advanced data science skills, I aim to innovate and help organizations achieve their revenue and guest satisfaction goals.

So, whether I'm analyzing data, exploring the breathtaking Arctic, chasing the Northern Lights, or indulging in the vibrant world of Japanese anime, I'm always on the lookout for new adventures and opportunities to grow!

By employing both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, including random forest models and clustering techniques, the project aims to provide insights into the relative effectiveness of formal education versus certifications in enhancing employability and salary potential. The findings are intended to inform learners, educational institutions, and policymakers about the most beneficial educational investments for career advancement.

## Comparative Analysis of Hotel Reviews: A Case Study of New York Marriott Marquis and Competitors

This study offers a detailed comparative analysis of hotel reviews for the New York Marriott Marquis and its top five competitors in New York City. By detecting languages, applying topic modeling, conducting sentiment analysis, and visualizing various metrics, we aim to derive actionable insights. The primary goal is to provide recommendations that can ultimately enhance customer satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge. Of importance, this dataset is not a definitive representation of the hotel‚Äôs operations but instead an example for educational purposes derived from a limited set of reviews from 2012.

## Safeguarding the Blue Skies: Airline Safety through Data

This project involves five small data visualization tasks aimed at addressing negative public perception of airline safety due to recent media reports. The tasks include creating an internal dashboard, preparing an executive summary, writing a blog post, designing an infographic, and recording a video presentation. Each task builds on the previous one using data from various sources to analyze and visualize trends and statistics that support the safety of air travel. The dashboard and executive summary are intended for internal review, while the blog post, infographic, and video presentation target external audiences. The project emphasizes effective storytelling, ethical considerations, and appropriate visualization techniques to communicate the airline's message clearly and accurately.
